The dataset is gotten from https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1665861154800133&usg=AOvVaw2uBbRGj4YDP6SNwuvkmOUC

**Data Wrangling Steps**
Performed some operations on the data to tidy the data like:
dropping na values, 
changing data types, 
and also changed the form of the start and end time (Created 4 new columns to hold this values) to get the hours in the time.

The new shape of the data is now 174952 rows and 21 columns.


## Summary of Findings

This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The dataset was for 2019, Feb.

There are more subcribers compared to customers. Also, there are more men taking rides compared to the other genders. Typically, these riders fall between the ages of 25 and 45. Though there are more elderly men i.e those that fall above 45 years.



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation I focused on showing the proportion of the genders and user types present in the dataset, the age distribution and how the age of the users relate with how long the ride a bike.

Found out that most of the users prefer to start baking at around 5pm. Though the earlier they go out the longer the durations of these bike rides.

Only the younger riders tends to have longer durations.

Ticket ID is: 1633306.
